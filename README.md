# Authenticated ToDos

REST API in Node.js+Typescript+Docker that implements a secure API (with authentication and authorization) where users can create, retrieve, update, and delete their own ToDos, ensuring that they can only access their own data.

## Hints

----> Implement input validation to ensure that requests are properly formatted and contain the information we expect.

----> Focus on building a secure and maintainable application with a clean code structure.

----> Your server should return appropriate HTTP response codes depending on each situation.

----> Tests are a plus! Unit tests, integration tests, whichever you want to use to ensure your application is secure and your code does what it pretends to do, we love it!
